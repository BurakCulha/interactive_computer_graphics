## In this project simple normal mapping and displacement mapping is implemented.  

## This project will include using both tessellation shaders and geometry shaders.

## initializes opengl context via glfw. 

## program takes inputs from user via dear imgui.

## program draws a quad using patches.

## tessellates the quad upon users input.

## displaces the newly created vertices.

## and using shadow mapping creates shadow.

## the user can activate the triangulation of displaced vertices via gui.
